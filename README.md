# HUNGARIAN_ALGORITHM
An efficient approach to solve job assignment problems. Job assignment mainly refers to assigning jobs to various workers in a company such that all the jobs can be done by spending the least amount of money.
In Todayâ€™s World, a lot of employees are required in all the companies of the world be it Google or Microsoft. 
Due to large number of employees, a huge amount of capital is required nowadays to ensure all the tasks of a day is completed well in time and with perfection. 
Depending upon the ease with which an employee can do a particular task, he/she charges money. 
These days all the employees are jack of all trades and a master in one. 
Thus, almost all the employees applying for a job in the company can do various other things. 
For example, a Software Engineer can also handle the Management of Internet along with developing software. 
Nowadays, it has become very important for the company to allocate jobs to the employees in such a manner that they have to invest the least amount of money possible, which would help them to save money for future purposes and also ensure that the jobs are done.  
In order to get a job in a company, one needs to first apply for that particular job and must have enough skill to compete with all other employees, who are applying for the job. 
Once the application is selected, one has to undergo certain tests to become eligible for the personal interview with the board members.
Once this round is cleared, every selected employee is called for the interview, where they are shortlisted according to their eligibility.
Now, if a company finds out that two or more employees are of the same talent and calibre to do a job, then it selects the one who offers to take least salary among all the shortlisted employees.
This may also be the case for various other jobs in the same company. 
This process of choosing the correct employee becomes exhaustive once the number of jobs along with the number of shortlisted candidates increases. 
Not only assigning jobs in a company can be solved by the algorithm proposed by me but also there are various other problems in our day to day life where this algorithm can be applied. 
For example, this algorithm would help us to select the roles of players in a baseball team. 
To be a part of a baseball team, one has to undergo various tests so that the coach can determine which position would be perfect for a particular player.
The tests include Hitting test, Speed Test, Pitching test, Throwing test, Fielding test, Reach test and Reaction test. 
Each and every player of a baseball team has to undergo these tests so that they can be amongst the playing nine.
Now once all the tests are completed, the coach has to determine the team in such a way that all arenas of the team mainly defence and attack are covered.
Since the number of players appearing for the test is large, it becomes difficult for the coach to determine the best players. 
So he can segregate the players on the basis of the role they want to play in the team.
He can use Hungarian Algorithm for each category in order to find the combination which can provide him with players having maximum skills. 
Then, depending upon the number of players needed for a particular role, the coach can select that many players for the playing nine and thus, he can make the best team out of all the players. 
This is just another example of a daily life situation where Hungarian Algorithm can be applied. 
Through the algorithm, one can also solve various other problems of assignment. 
For example, let us consider that there is a company having three employees at three different locations of the country Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. 
The company has to send these employees to three other cities Hyderabad, Jaipur and Bangalore. 
The cost of them to travel from their respective cities to the desired cities is calculated. 
Now, it becomes important for the company to choose which employ should go to which city so that it has to spend minimum amount of money to accomplish the desired task. 
This problem can easily and effectively be solved by the algorithm proposed and selected by me.
